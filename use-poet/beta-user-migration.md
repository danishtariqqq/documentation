# Beta User Migration Guide

Now you can record your creative works on the Bitcoin Mainnet blockchain, while taking advantage of many other behind-the-scenes improvements to the Po.et protocol.

## Migrating to Mainnet

To get started:

1. Create a new account and obtain a new API Token for your app (see instructions below)
2. Update your app with the new API Token and the new API URL: **[https://api.poetnetwork.net](https://api.poetnetwork.net)**

## Create Account and Get an API Token

1. Go to [https://explorer.poetnetwork.net](https://explorer.poetnetwork.net)
2. Click on **Login / Sign Up**
3. Under **Sign Up**, enter your email address and set a password, then confirm the verification email sent to you
4. Click on **Get API Token**
5. Switch the toggle from Testnet to Mainnet (unless you want to use Testnet first for testing purposes)
6. Click on **Create API Token for Live** to generate a new API Token
7. Click on the created API Token to copy it to your clipboard
8. Save the API Token in a secure place (don't share it with anyone)

## WordPress Users

We will be releasing a version 2.0 of the Po.et WordPress Plugin soon. Stay tuned to our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/poetapp/Lobby) for updates.

## Legacy Po.et

The legacy Po.et API ([https://frost.po.et](https://frost.po.et) & [https://api.frost.po.et](https://api.frost.po.et)) will continue to function until January 15, 2019, when we will close it down.

## Questions?

Please reach out to us on our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/poetapp/Lobby) if you have any questions about migrating, or for any general questions about Po.et.

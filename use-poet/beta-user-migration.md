# Beta User Migration Guide

Now you can record your creative works on the Bitcoin Mainnet blockchain, while taking advantage of many other behind-the-scenes improvements to the Po.et protocol.

## Migrating to Mainnet

So what has changed with the new release of Po.et's protocol that will affect how your app interacts with our API? Two things:

1. We are using a new domain: poetnetwork.net
2. API Tokens need to be created to access the new API

As a result, you will need to create a new account and obtain a new API Token for your app (see instructions below), and you will need to update your app with the new API URL ([https://api.poetnetwork.net](https://api.poetnetwork.net)).

## Create Account and Get an API Token

1. Go to [https://explorer.poetnetwork.net](https://explorer.poetnetwork.net).
2. Click on **Login / Sign Up**.
3. Under **Sign Up**, enter your email address and set a password, then confirm the verification email sent to you.
4. Click on **Get API Token**.
5. Switch the toggle from Testnet to Mainnet (unless you want to use Testnet first for testing purposes).
6. Click on **Create API Token for Live** to generate a new API Token.
7. Click on the created API Token to copy it to your clipboard.
8. Save the API Token in a secure place (don't share it with anyone).

## WordPress Users

We will be releasing a version 2.0 of the Po.et WordPress Plugin soon. Stay tuned to our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/poetapp/Lobby) for updates.

## Legacy Po.et

The legacy Po.et API (https://api.frost.po.et) will continue to function as usual until January 15, 2019, at which time we will close it down.

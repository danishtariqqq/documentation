## Create a Post

1. Go to **Posts**, then click on **Add New**.

![Po.et Badge](poet-badge.png)
4. Click on **Publish**.

Your post is automatically registered on the Po.et Network!

If you included a badge in your post, you can click on it to see your registered work on the Po.et Explorer website, Po.et's app for exploring works registered on the Po.et Network. Please note it will take about 10 minutes for the work to be anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain, so you won't see your work in Explorer until that has happened.

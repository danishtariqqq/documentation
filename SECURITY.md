# Reporting Security Issues

We at Po.et believe that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps to ensure the security and privacy of their users. We value the security community, and we aim to work with responsible security researchers to make Po.et's open source protocol and apps reliable and secure for all Po.et users.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of Po.et's apps or protocol, we strongly encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to resolve the problem quickly.

## Reporting an Issue

Submit your report by email to **security@po.et**. Please do not contact us through any other channels (in other words, do not use social media).

Upon submitting a report, you will receive a response from us within 48 hours of submission. We may ask you for further details and/or assistance in reproducing the issue. Please work with us to ensure we understand the issue correctly and fully. After receiving your report, we will keep you informed of our progress towards a fix and full announcement about the issue.

Once we receive your report, we will:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit our codebase to find similar problems.
  * Prepare a fix for all actively maintained releases.
  * Release the fix and announce the security vulnerability/bug in the release notes for the fix.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

In the spirit of responsible disclosure, we ask that you:

  * Give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue you report before making public any information about the report or sharing such information with others.
  * Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, such as the destruction of data and interruption or degradation of our services.
  * Do not exploit a security issue you discover for any reason.
  * Do not violate any other applicable laws or regulations.
